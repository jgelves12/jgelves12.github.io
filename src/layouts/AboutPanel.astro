    <p class="mb-4">Hello, I'm <span class="font-bold">Jose Gelves</span>, a passionate <span class="font-bold">Front-End Developer</span> with a deep love for programming that began when I was just <span class="font-bold">9 years old</span>. From a young age, I discovered the magic of technology, and it was at that moment I knew I wanted to dedicate my life to creating and shaping the web.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">My journey into the world of programming started with <span class="italic"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" class="underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a></span>, the language that structures the web. I was fascinated by how I could build something from scratch with just a few lines of code. Soon after, I delved into <span class="italic"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" class="underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS</a></span>, where I learned to style and bring those structures to life, creating visually appealing and functional interfaces. As time went on, I felt the need to make my projects more interactive, which led me to learn <span class="italic"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" class="underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JavaScript</a></span>, the language that adds dynamism and functionality to web pages.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">As my experience grew, I discovered <span class="font-bold"><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tailwind CSS</a></span>, a tool that has allowed me to design efficiently, focusing on functionality and aesthetics without compromising development speed. Tailwind has become an essential part of my workflow, helping me create modern and responsive interfaces that adapt to any device.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">My curiosity and desire to learn more led me to explore <span class="font-bold"><a href="https://astro.build/" class="underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro JS</a></span>, where I found an innovative way to build fast and scalable websites, using a modern approach that takes advantage of current technologies.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">My interest in programming hasn't been limited to Front-End development. Before embarking on the <span class="font-bold"><a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/" class="underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS50</a></span> course at Harvard, I had already spent a considerable amount of time exploring <span class="italic"><a href="https://www.python.org/" class="underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a></span>, a language that captivated me with its simplicity and power. I learned to build <span class="italic"><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/" class="underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APIs using Flask</a></span>, seamlessly connecting the user interface with server-side logic. This knowledge has allowed me to work on more comprehensive projects, integrating my skills in both <span class="font-bold">Front-End</span> and <span class="font-bold">Back-End</span> development.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Currently, I'm enrolled in the prestigious <span class="font-bold"><a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/" class="underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS50</a></span> course at Harvard, a course that is challenging me and expanding my horizons in computer science. Although I already had experience with <span class="italic"><a href="https://www.python.org/" class="underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a></span>, <span class="font-bold"><a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/" class="underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS50</a></span> is reinforcing my foundations and taking my understanding and application of this language to new heights.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">In addition to my programming journey, I am also in my seventh semester of studying <span class="font-bold">Political Science</span> at the <span class="font-bold"><a href="https://uniandes.edu.co" class="underline text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of the Andes</a></span>. My passion for programming has not only fueled my love for technology but has also made me realize that I have a deep desire to help people. Through programming, I hope to create solutions that make a positive impact on society.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">While I don't consider myself a professional yet, I'm taking my first steps towards developing code that I will present to the industry. With effort, dedication, and commitment, I hope to reach that level. I'm excited about what the future holds and ready to keep building and contributing to the fascinating world of technology.</p>
